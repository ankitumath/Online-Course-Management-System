# 🎓 Online Course Management System

A full-stack **MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)** based Online Course Management System that allows administrators, instructors, and students to interact through a modern learning platform.

This project is being built from scratch to understand the complete workflow of a production-ready Learning Management System (LMS), including authentication, authorization, course management, enrollments, progress tracking, and much more.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The Online Course Management System is a web application that enables educational institutions or independent instructors to create and manage online courses while allowing students to enroll, learn, and track their progress.

The project follows modern web development practices and implements secure authentication, role-based authorization, responsive UI, REST APIs, and scalable backend architecture.
